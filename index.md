My research field is *Digital Economy*.

I currently focus on understanding macro-level economic activity from the perspective of digital transformation of micro households and firms using high-resolution geographic big data, micro survey data, textual big data, and enterprise, using causal inference methods.

Before joining Sichuan University Business School, I received my PhD in economic from the <a href="https://riem.swufe.edu.cn/">Southwestern University of Finance and Economics</a>.
